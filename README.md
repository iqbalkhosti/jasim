## How to run build script
To run the Makefile, run `make` in your terminal. You may need to install the following to run the Makefile:
- `make`  
- `PyInstaller`  

Other commands:  
- `clean` remove built files  
- `rebuild` cleans, then builds  

The build script will only run if all dependency have been installed on your desired python version. Currently, tkVideoPlayer is not updated for the latest version of python and as such this build script requires python 3.10.9 in order for tkVideoPlayer to function.
